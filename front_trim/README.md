# Front trim samples

Describe the Wurlitzer 2700/2710 front trim (P/N 122033, 122034) in STL files

## Disclaimer

This is a hack, and just for testing some sizing before sending off to a metal fab shop.

## Why

The Wurlitzer 2700's front trim takes a LOT of damage because if its placement. These models are for ascertaining the right fit before having new pieces fabricated. YMMV.

## How

The [trim-cross-section.stl](./trim-cross-section.stl) model describes a cross-section of the trim.
The [trim-top-cap.stl](./trim-top-cap.stl) model describes the top of the trim, where it fits between the cabinet and the keyboard frame casting (P/N 122443, 122449).
