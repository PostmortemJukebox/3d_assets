# Replace the factory tweeter

Replace the factory tweeter in a Wurlitzer 2700

## Disclaimer

The author is not an electrical engineer. While nothing in test has blown up or caught on fire, you should bear in mind that this is a hack and there is no guarantee that it will work safely (or at all) for you.

## Why

The factory-installed Wurlitzer 2700 tweeter has a paper cone and metal parts. After decades of use, misuse, abuse, or disuse, the tweeter may make bad sounds or no sounds at all. Finding a proper match for the factory tweeter can be challenging because of mounting hole placement.

## How

The [tweeter_frame_tpt-s3_v1.stl](./tweeter_frame_tpt-s3_v1.stl) model is an adapter plate for the Wurlitzer 2700/2710 to allow the use of a Timpano TPT-ST3 tweeter instead of factory equipment.
