# Put a TFT screen in the album art window

Use TFT screen parts to add a display to the 1963 Wurlitzer 2700/2710

## Why

The Wurlitzer 2700/2710 models came with a window in which to display a 7" record sleeve. Because static art is less fun than motion, we'll install a screen in the window, which we can hook up to a computer via HDMI.

## How

The [7-inch-record-screen.stl](./7-inch-record-screen.stl) model fits into a 7" record sleeve, and has a gap in which to place the TFT glass from an [Eyoyo 8" HDMI monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FHDL1DE). You may need to trim the model down to align with the hole in the record sleeve.

The [lcd_controller_board_tray.stl](./lcd_controller_board_tray.stl) holds the controller board from the monitor.

You'll have to disassemble the monitor and extract the glass and controller board. Be careful. The glass is quite fragile.


## Other required parts

[Flexible flat cable extension](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LTZ7XPQ): You'll need this to get the needed distance between the glass and the controller board.
