# Flipper Free Play Switch 

Replace a cabinet lock with a flipper switch for free play.

## Disclaimer

## Why

The Wurlitzer 2700 free play switch is buried inside the cabinet, under the keyboard. If you're not expecting to make money on nickels and dimes, relocating the switch can bring more joy (and style) to your old Wurlitzer 2700/2710.

## How

The <flipper_spdt_switch_v1.stl> model has a round plate on one end and a hollow box on the other end. The round plate goes over the post of the pinball flipper switch, and is secured by using the regular PAL nut for the flipper switch. The box end holds the SPDT switch. Holes in the box end align with the holes in the switch body, and screws or a length of wire may be used to secure the switch.

Unsolder the factory free play switch and use hookup wire to connect the SPDT switch. For convenience and easier ongoing maintenance, consider using latching Molex connectors to make a quick disconnect harness between the keyboard and the flipper switch.
